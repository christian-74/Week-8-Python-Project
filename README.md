# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

## 📌 Project Description

This project involves the analysis and visualization of global COVID-19 data, focusing on trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and daily new cases across selected countries. The goal is to identify patterns, anomalies, and key insights from the pandemic's progression using real-world data.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Analyze the cumulative and daily trends of COVID-19 cases across selected countries.
* Compare pandemic trends among countries such as Kenya, India and United States.
* Visualize the progression of the outbreak using line and bar charts.
* Summarize key insights and unusual patterns in the data.

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

## ▶️ How to Run/View the Project

1. Open the `Week 8 Project.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run each cell in sequence to execute the data loading, processing, visualization, and analysis.
3. Ensure the required libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`) are installed in your Python environment.

## 📈 Key Insights and Reflections

* US had the highest total confirmed cases (2.44M) and the highest death rate (3.6%) among the selected countries.
* India followed closely in case numbers, indicating sustained outbreaks.
* Kenya had relatively lower case numbers (17,975) but exhibited significant variation in daily new cases.
* Discrepancies in recovery and active case data suggest inconsistent reporting standards.
* Reliable data is crucial for managing public health responses and comparing the pandemic’s impact across regions.

This project provided hands-on experience in data cleaning, transformation, and storytelling through visual analytics. It highlights the power of data science in understanding and communicating complex global challenges.
